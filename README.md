# Movie Master

Movie to-do list application where users build watchlists with the search tools provided. Users can browse movies scraped from [IMDB's Top 250 Movie List](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/) or search [OMDB's database](http://www.omdbapi.com/) for movies to add to their watchlist. Once added, users can mark movies as `watched`, shift them back to the watchlist, or remove them completely.
